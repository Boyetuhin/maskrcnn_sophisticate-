# Codehub


**Design Philosophy:**
> What is it?

* Setting up the development environment, tools chains is time consuming and repetitive.
* Migrating from one system to another, in case of new setup after formatting of the system, system crashes is painful tasks.
* During this, change in the user name and re-configuration is highly manually.
* Containers plays key roles in creating such re-usable environment

**System build for multi-purpose tasks**
* Computer Vision and Image Processing
* Machine Learning
* Deep Learning
* 3D GIS - Photogrammetry, Point Cloud, LiDAR, 3D Modeling
* Data Analysis, Data Visualization
* VR,AR
* Computer Graphics, VFX
