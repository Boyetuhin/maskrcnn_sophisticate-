#   - h5py rests on an object-oriented Python wrapping of the HDF5 C API. Almost anything you can do from C in HDF5, you can do from h5py.
#   - HDF-EOS employs standard HDF objects, including images, tables, text, and data arrays.

# - The HDF5 format is great to store huge amount of numerical data and manipulate this data from numpy.
# - Once you are done with training using Keras, you can save your network weights in HDF5 binary data format. In order to use this, you must # have the h5py package installed, which we did during installation.
# - For example, itâ€™s easily possible to slice multi-terabyte datasets stored on disk as if they were real numpy arrays. You can also store multiple datasets in a single file, iterate over them or check out the .shape and .dtype attributes.
